# POC-Raspberry-NFC

POC-Raspberry-NFC is the Raspberry side of project 'POC NFC'

For this project, I use the "Explore-NFC" shield made for Raspberry PI and his dependencies.

I'm aware that there is a lot of best solution to do the job of some functions but I was limited by time.
So please, feel free to share your trick to replace the code you are scared to.
